# Khod-Kaar: An LLM-based code-writing agent

[![khod-kaar CI](https://github.com/danmohad/khod-kaar/actions/workflows/ci-main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danmohad/khod-kaar/actions/workflows/ci-main.yml)

## Description
Given a user's objective, `khod-kaar` will develop, test, document and execute code autonomously to achieve that objective.

`khod-kaar` will first guide the LLM to develop a plan for how to achieve the user's objective, and to output and render UML diagrams to show concretely the software development plan.

Once the user consents to the plan, `khod-kaar` will guide the LLM to develop code relevant to the user's goal in a step-wise manner, including version control and testing.

Since `khod-kaar` has direct access to the shell, it provides the LLM with direct feedback from program execution and testing.

When the user's objective is met, the program gracefully exits.

## How does it work
This code performs three key functions: 
1. Interaction with an LLM
  - A substantial 'system prompt' is used to guide LLM behavior
  - User inputs are wrapped in additional context prior to dispaching to the LLM
2. LLM output parsing for code
  - LLM output in natural language is needed both for user comprehension and to improve available context to the LLM as the program progresses
  - LLM output in code is needed to achieve the user's objective
3. Code execution via the shell
  - The code generated by the LLM is executed directly in the shell
  - All outputs of the execution are captured, formatted and returned to the LLM to give closed-loop feedback

These actions are performed iteratively to achieve the specified objective.

## Requirements
- A basic workstation
- An internet connection
- OpenAI API credentials

## Setup
1. Clone the repo locally.
    - `git clone https://github.com/danmohad/khod-kaar`
2. Navigate to the cloned repo.
    - `cd /path/to/khod-kaar`
3. Ensure your OpenAI API credentials are available as environment variables. A `.env` file is most convenient for this.
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - `OPENAI_ORG_KEY`

### Containerized with Docker
Running the code in a containerized environment is safer for your file system. A Docker file is provided with the repo to set up a Debian environment with some common dependencies.

### Ready-for-dev with VSCode
The easiest way to get started running and contributing to `khod-kaar` is by loading it as a dev container in VSCode. There are already some debugging cases set up in `.vscode/launch.json`.

## How to run it
Suppose your objective is "to write, test and execute a simple Python program that writes 'Hello, World!'" Then to command `khod-kaar` to do this for you, it is as simple as:
```
python khod_kaar.py -o "to write, test and execute a simple Python program that writes 'Hello, World!'"
```

Additional parameters are available and can be viewed by executing `python khod_kaar.py --help`.

## Don't be evil
It's not difficult to think of ways to perform nefarious and antisocial actions with AI in general and LLMs in particular. Don't do them.

## Don't be reckless
Understand that `khod-kaar` interacts with the shell where it is run. Commands and code executed by `khod-kaar` may damage your machine or even other machines; it has just as much authority over the environment in which it is run as you do. Be sure you understand each shell command `khod-kaar` will execute before approving it. Exercise extreme caution in using the autopilot `-a` flag, as it is meant primarily for debugging and demonstration purposes and __will execute arbitrary code on your machine witout your consent and outside of your control__.

## What's with the name?
In many languages of south-central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, the word _khod_ means 'self' and _kaar_ means 'work' or 'action'. Thus, to many people, _khod kaar_ can render a meaning like 'autonomous action', which is what this repo does. _Khod_ also sounds like 'code', and _code kaar_ has a meaning approaching 'code worker', which is what this repo is. In Persian the term _khod kaar_ specifically means 'ball-point pen'. When compared to a quill or reed, a ball-point pen is certainly closer to autonomous action by easing the task of the writer, and that is also what this repo aims to do.
